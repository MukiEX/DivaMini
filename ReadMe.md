# Diva Arcade Controller

## 3:5 scale, or 60% size

This is some basic design files for a Project Diva arcade controller.
The design goal is for everything to be at 60% size, from the buttons
to the slider to the LEDs.

Mostly came up with this because I found 60mm buttons and realized that
they would fit, side-by-side, inside a fightstick panel (Excellence Model T)

Idealing this will be feature complete, with LEDs and low-profile optical
button switches (they won't fit in the controller housing otherwise), but
I haven't had time to implement the optical switch yet. I might try using
leaf switches in the meanwhile, though.

## Laser Cut Panels

The file `Acrylic/Miku_Panel_Guide.svg` contains the design for 3 acrylic
panels. One is 12.125 inches wide, while the other two are 12 inches wide,
mostly because 12x12 acrylic is cheaper than 16x12 acrylic, and you don't
need the full width for the other layers.

Altogether 3 1.5mm acrylic panels come out to 4.5mm, which is the top panel
depth of the Excellence Model T arcade enclosure. I would love to design
for other enclosures or even for a 3D printed enclosure, but I have not
had time to dig into that yet.
