#Diva Arcade Controller
##3:5 scale, or 60% size

This is some basic design files for a Project Diva arcade controller.
The design goal is for everything to be at 60% size, from the buttons
to the slider to the LEDs.

Mostly came up with this because I found 60mm buttons and realized that
they would fit, side-by-side, inside a fightstick panel (Excellence Model T)

Idealing this will be feature complete, with LEDs and low-profile optical
button switches (they won't fit in the controller housing otherwise), but
I haven't had time to implement the optical switch yet. I might try using
leaf switches in the meanwhile, though.
